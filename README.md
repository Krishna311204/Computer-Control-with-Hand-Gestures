# Hand Gesture Mouse Control using Python

This project enables mouse control using hand gestures detected through a webcam. It leverages MediaPipe for real-time hand tracking, OpenCV for video capture and processing, and PyAutoGUI for controlling mouse operations.

## Features

- Move the mouse using the index finger.
- Perform a left-click using a pinch gesture (thumb + index finger).
- Perform a right-click using a pinch gesture (thumb + middle finger).
- Drag and drop by holding a pinch gesture (thumb + index finger).
- Scroll by bringing the index and middle fingers close together and moving the hand vertically.

## Technologies Used

- [MediaPipe](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/) – for hand tracking.
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) – for video processing.
- [PyAutoGUI](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/) – for simulating mouse actions.
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) – for efficient numerical computations.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
